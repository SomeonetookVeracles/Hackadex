A zero 2w powered pentesting tool designed to look like a retro game console

I love the idea and feel of the flipper zero, but I feel like it's missing in a lot of areas when it comes to functionality -- specifically when it comes to wifi. I'm studying to get my CEH (certified ethical hacker) certification currently, and I believe that making a project like this will help me cement the core ideas and principles more than routine studying. I plan on adding the following stuff currently
- A TFT touchscreen with indicator lights
- 2 USB C Ports for data and maybe power
- A decently sized battery for portability (I'm thinking 10000 MaH currently but it depends on price)
- ESP-32 chip for extra wifi functionality
- A U.FL connector on the outside for increased signal strength
- And a 3 stage switch to alternate between on, a low power mode, and off.
- programmable neopixel indicators
- BadUSB compatibility

There's a lot here, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get everything on it, but I want to at least document everything I'm working towards on this.
